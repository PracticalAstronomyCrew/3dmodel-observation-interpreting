Remarks,,,,,,"They were very interesting, especially once they were explained ",,,,,,,"For the variable star models, I already understood very well how they behaved from my own code and images, which is why I didn't really learn anything new from them. Also because of the size of the variable star models the difference in brightness between images wasn't too clear nor was it clear which star in that model was the variable star on first sight (our star is definitely not the brightest in our images)."
